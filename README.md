## About me

"I just thought you'd like to know I can read. You got anything needs readin' I can do it ... " â€” Dill

I have two public repositories, they contain:

* notes on Computer Science and Python
* notes on technical writing and the English language.

  <summary><h4> For potential employers: </h4></summary>
  
  The content I've made public is indeed less than what you might find on another prospect's
  profile, but I will not upload anything and everything just to impress you. I could very easily
  upload every single module from the many online courses I've taken and show hundreds of files of
  Python and R code. Many people do that sort of thing and, while in a handful of cases that has
  great public value, it's usually only good for the profile owner to "check the box" for potential
  employers. (And those repos are often used by other course takers to cheat at tests, which
  devalues all of us.) 
  
  I'm not the type to just "create content" and go through the motions ...  I  invite you to actually 
  look at my files and see their value as notes/summaries and, sometimes, critical interpretations of
  the theory.
