# About me

"I just thought you'd like to know I can read. You got anything needs readin' I can do it ... " â€”
 Dill

My repositories contain:

* notes on Computer Science and Python
* notes on technical writing and the English language
* simple R code for common Data Science tasks
* functions I've created in R
* notes on BASH usage (including a little bit on linux administration and configuring commonly used tools)

### For potential employers

The content I've made public is, indeed, less than what you might find on another prospect's
profile, but I will not upload anything and everything just to impress you. I'm not the type to
just "create content" and go through the motions. I could very easily upload every single module
from the many online courses I've taken and show hundreds of files with Python and R code. Many
people do that sort of thing and, while in a handful of cases that has great public value, it's
usually only good for the profile owner to "check the box" in job applicationsâ€”and those repos are
often used by other course takers to cheat at tests, which devalues all of us.

I invite you to actually look at my files and see their value as notes/summaries and critical interpretations of the theory.
